This is the s2i-ace S2I image:
To use it, install S2I: https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image

Build requires either a build.gradle file (for Gradle build) or a pom.xml file (for Maven build) in the root directory

Sample invocation:

s2i build <source code path/URL> s2i-ace <application image>

You can then run the resulting image via:
docker run <application image>
